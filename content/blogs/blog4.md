---
My name is Philipp Obradovics. I grew up in the South East of Austria in a small village called Kohfidisch. From the age of 6 I was very passionate about football and spent every free minute on the football pitch and later even attended a high school that provided football trainings in the morning additionally to my regular ones in the evening.

After graduating from my high school, I decided to pursue a Bachelor in Business Administration in Krems. Even though my major was in project management I got more and more interested in finance. In my third semester I had the chance to study abroad in Toronto. Among the highlights there was the corporate finance course after which I was I was convinced that I want to work in this field.
After graduating from IMC Krems I worked for a year at KPMG in Vienna before I decided to join London Business School to pursue a Masters in Financial Analysis.
