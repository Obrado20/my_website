As shortly touched upon in the “About me” section I am very passionate about football. I started playing when I was 6 and did it on a competitive until the age of 22. My first ever team were the Under 8s of my home village. I can still remember my first game, the first goal and those orange shirts we used to wear for our games like it was yesterday.

Once we got older we had to merge with other villages as the team size got larger and we started playing on larger and larger fields. We were quite successful in this team and had opportunities to play against teams of every part of Austria and even some international tournaments.

When I was around 15 I joined the team of my old village again and started playing with adults. This was obviously a huge step since the opponents now were just so much stronger physically. I spent 2 years at this club before I decided to join another club in my region that played in a higher league. My biggest highlight there was the debut for the first time in the 3rd division in Austria. I only found out that I will play on the morning of the game. Then also our bus ran late and we had only a fraction of the normal time to warm up and get ready. On top of that we played against one of the top teams in this league while we were fighting relegation. It was an extremely tough game which peaked 10 minutes before the final whistle when I cleared a ball from the goalline. We drew this game and managed to stay in the league by exactly one point.
