I grew up in a small village in Austria with around 1000 people called Kohfidisch. As you can imagine, there is not much going on in Kohfidisch, however, you will be surprised to hear that its actually one of the larger villages in this region. The main attraction of Kohfidisch is the so-called “wine mountain” which is just a hill in the middle of the village where a lot of inhabitants have a cottage where they make wine. Fortunately, my parents also have one of those. Harvesting the grapes was one the absolute highlights every year as the entire family came together to first get the job done and then celebrate with a great dinner.

The second most interesting thing in Kohfidisch most likely is the football club. The football club currently plays in the highest league in Burgenland, the county its in, and usually has a game every second Saturday except in the winter. Usually, the whole population (I made that sound way bigger than it is I guess) comes together to watch the team play. Besides playing football, the football club also hosts a number of other events and is pretty active in the social life as well.

Besides all of the above, as I said there is not much going on in Kohfidisch. In terms of stores we have two grocery stores and three taverns which would be the equivalent to the pubs in London.
